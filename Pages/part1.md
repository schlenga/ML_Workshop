Part 1: Playing around with the ideas
======

Machine Learning is hidden from the user most of the time, even though it powers many modern applications.

So, before we get our hands dirty, we look at some different instances of ML.


## Your phone assistants (~20 minutes)

If you have a modern Android or iPhone (and activated the assistant features), you have access to Siri or the Google Assistant.

If possible:

- form pairs of people having access to Siri and Google Assistant (+x)
- explain to each other if and how you use those tools
- try to make a little comparison: what works well, what doesn't, are there notable differences in user guidance/addressing etc

## Tensorflow.js (~30 minutes)

Visit [tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/). We look at a couple of examples there.
