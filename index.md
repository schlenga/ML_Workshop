Welcome to the Workshop on Machine Learning!
============================================

The goal of this workshop is to get everyone fluent on the concepts and lingo of ML, understand neural nets and be able to use Python and TensorFlow up to a certain degree.

## The rough plan

- Getting to know what machine learning _does_ and how it _works_
	- using digital assitants on your phones, google/apple photos...
	- using [this fun webpage](https://js.tensorflow.org)
- What does ML mean?
- Making sense of neural nets
- Breaking the machine
- Quick dive into python
	- using **jupyter notebooks**
- Implementing/understanding a simple NN for the [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
	- here's the [Jupyter NB](https://github.com/schlenga/ML_Workshop/blob/master/Code/Iris_Classification.ipynb)

## Structure

- Part 1: [link](Pages/part1.md)
- Part 2: [link](Pages/part2.md)

## Homework:

- try to implement the "AND"-gate similar to [here](https://github.com/schlenga/ML_Workshop/blob/master/Code/Logical%20Gates%20With%20Tensorflow.ipynb)
- watch the 3Blue1Brown playlist on Machine Learning on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk&list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi)
- *advanced*: try to implement the "XOR"-gate as above. Inspiration [here](https://medium.com/@jaschaephraim/elementary-neural-networks-with-tensorflow-c2593ad3d60b)
