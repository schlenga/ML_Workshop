# Welcome to the Workshop on Machine Learning!

The goal of this workshop is to get everyone fluent on the concepts and lingo of ML, understand neural nets and be able to use Python and TensorFlow up to a certain degree.

## The rough plan

- Getting to know a learning machine
	- using [this fun webpage](https://js.tensorflow.org)
- What does ML mean?
- Making sense of neural nets
- Breaking the machine
- Quick dive into python
- Implementing/understanding a simple NN for the [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set)
	- here's the [Jupyter NB](https://github.com/schlenga/ML_Workshop/blob/master/Code/Iris_Classification.ipynb)
